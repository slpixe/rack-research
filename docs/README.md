## Documentation Guidelines

When adding new documentation:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `vendor-name-report.md`)
2. **Structure**: Include clear sections with headers
3. **Links**: Use relative links to other docs
4. **Reports**: Name reports with format `{vendor}-{type}-report.md`
