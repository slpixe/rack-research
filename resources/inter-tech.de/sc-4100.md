# SC-4100

The SC-4100 is a case for Mini-ITX Mainboards with a quadruple Hot-Swap rack for hard drives.

One included 80mm fan, as well as an optional 40mm fan, cares for clean air and therefore for an impeccable cooling system.

One Flex ATX or 1U server power supply can be mounted. The slot opening is suitable for the mounting of a short flat graphic card. One 2.5" hard drive or one SSD can also be mounted. One lockable door completes this total package.
