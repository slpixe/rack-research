# IPC 3U-3416

The 3U 3416 is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution.

With its excellent quality and finish, Inter-Tech established the basis for a very variable case.

The 3U 3416 offers the possibility to install maximal sixteen 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap HDDs, one Slim DVD external and three internal 2.5" HDDs. The 3U 3416 has five fans included, from which three 120mm fans are mounted directly at the back of the drive brackets. Another two 60mm fans are mounted at the back and ensure a reliable and optimal cooling.

Additional extras like the reusable and perforated slot brackets and the lid with the snap lock round off the picture.
