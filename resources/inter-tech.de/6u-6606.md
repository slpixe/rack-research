# 6U-6606

The IPC 6U-6606 is a perfect case for a cost-efficient Mini Server System. Using high-level material combined with excellent workmanship we created a variable and reliable industrial case.

So the 6U-6606 supports ATX or PS/2 redundant power supplies, up to six 2.5"/3.5" Hot-Plug hard disks, seven internal 2.5" and nine internal 3.5" devices, one external 5.25" devices and mainboards up to E-ATX size.

The extricable mainboard holder eases mounting of components and supports mounting of two 80mm fans and cutouts for two DB9/ DB15 ports. The rear HDD Hot-Swap frames as well as the front door are lockable to protect your hardware and data. Additional three 120mm fans and perforated slot brackets optimize air flow. Serial USB 3.2 Gen1 front connectors round up the case.
