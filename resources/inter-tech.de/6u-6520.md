# 6U-6520

The IPC 6U-6520 is a perfect case for a cost-efficient Mini Server System. Using high-level material combined with excellent workmanship we created a variable and reliable industrial case.

So the 6U-6520 supports ATX or PS/2 redundant power supplies, up to twenty 2.5"/3.5" Hot-Plug hard disks, two internal 2.5" devices, two external 5.25" devices and mainboards up to E-ATX size.

The extricable mainboard holder eases mounting of components and includes two 80mm fans. Additional five 80mm fans and perforated slot brackets optimize air flow. Serial USB 3.2 Gen1 front connectors round up the case.
