# IPC 2U-2408

The 2U 2408 is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution.

With its excellent quality and finish, Inter-Tech established the basis for a very variable case.

The 2U 2408 offers the possibility to mount maximal eight 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap HDDs, one Slim DVD, two internal 3.5" and three internal 2.5" HDDs. The 2U 2408 has four 80mm fans, which are mounted directly at the back of the drive brackets and ensure a reliable and optimal cooling.

Additional extras like the reusable and perforated slot brackets and the lid with the snap locks round off the picture.

**Now new: Backplane with NVMe Support available as an upgrade.**
