# IPC 1.5U-1528-1

The 1.5U-1528-1 is the perfect rack for a small server system.

The special design in 1.5U enables you to run an external drive (2.5" or 3.5") in Hot-Swap mode on an ITX-Mainboard base. The interior offers the option to mount two additional 2.5" drives and more height for CPU-cooler than a regular 1U case.

Two serial 60mm fans behind the front panel ensure a reliable cooling. It also offers two USB front connectors in the front, next to the controls.
