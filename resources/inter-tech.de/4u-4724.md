# 4U-4724

The IPC 4U 4724 is the perfect rack for a small and cost-effective storage system.

Due to the excellent material quality, in combination with excellent workmanship, Inter-Tech has created the basis for an extremely variable case.

The case offers the possibility of installing a maximum of 24x 2.5" or 3.5" hot-swap hard disks, as well as two 2.5" internal hard disks. The IPC 4U 4724 is equipped with five fans installed as standard, of which there are three 120mm internally directly behind the drive brackets. Two additional 80mm fans on the back reliably ensure optimal cooling.

Additional extras such as the reusable and perforated slot brackets, USB 2.0 connections and the case lid with snap-in closures complete this excellent overall package.
