# 4U-4424

The 4U 4424 is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution. With its excellent quality and finish, Inter-Tech established the basis for a very variable case.

The 4U 4424 offers the possibility to install maximal twenty four 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap HDDs and two 2.5" or one 3.5" internal HDDs. The 4U 4424 has five fans as standard, from which three 120mm are mounted directly at the back of the drive brackets. In addition, two 80mm fans at the back ensure a reliable and optimal cooling.

Additional extras like the reusable and perforated slot brackets, the USB 3.0 connectors and the lid with the snap lock round off the picture.
