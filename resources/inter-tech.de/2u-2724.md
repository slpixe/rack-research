# 2U-2724

Maximum storage density in the smallest of spaces – the 2U storage enclosure has been specially developed for demanding server and storage applications. With 24 hot-swap bays for 2.5" drives and support for SAS3, SATA, and NVMe, it combines outstanding flexibility with maximum performance.

The sophisticated cooling concept with three hot-plug fans ensures a constant air flow – ideal for NVMe drives with high heat generation. The tool-free removable bays allow hard drives to be replaced during operation, minimizing maintenance times and maximizing availability.

The sturdy steel housing is designed for continuous operation in data centers and offers sufficient space for a wide variety of motherboard formats. Thanks to UUID management and alarm LEDs, administrators always have an overview of system status and identification.
