# IPC 2U-2404L

The 2U 2404L is the perfect rack for a low-priced storage system.

The excellent quality of the materials combined with superb workmanship establishes the basis for a very variable case.

The 2U 2404L offers the possibility to mount maximal four 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap HDDs and one internal 2.5" or 3.5" HDD (by using a 2.5" with 9.5mm height also a 3.5" HDD simultaneously). The 2U 2404L is equipped with three serial 40mm fans. At the rear of the chassis you can mount an ATX PSU with 80mm fan or a Mini-Redundant PS/2 PSU.

Both serial USB 3.0 front connectors round off the whole package.

**Now new: Backplane with NVMe Support available as an upgrade.**
