# 4U-4420

The 4U 4420 is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution. With its excellent quality and finish, Inter-Tech established the basis for a very variable case.

The 4U 4420 offers the possibility to install maximal twenty 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap HDDs, one Slim DVD external and three 2.5" or two 3.5" internal HDDs. The 4U 4420 has five fans as standard, from which three 120mm are mounted directly at the back of the drive brackets. In addition, two 80mm fans at the back ensure a reliable and optimal cooling.

Additional extras like the reusable and perforated slot brackets and the lid with the snap lock round off the picture.
