# IPC 2U-2412

The 2U 2412 is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution.

With its excellent quality and finish, Inter-Tech established the basis for a very variable case.

The 2U 2412 offers the possibility to install maximal twelve 2.5" or 3.5" Hot-Swap, two 2.5" or one 3.5" HDD. The 2U 2412 has four 80mm fans, which are mounted directly at the back of the drive brackets and ensure a reliable and optimal cooling.

Additional extras like the reusable and perforated slot brackets, the USB 3.0 connectors and the lid with the snap lock round off the picture.

**Now new: Backplane with NVMe Support available as an upgrade.**
