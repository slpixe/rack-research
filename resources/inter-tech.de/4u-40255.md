# IPC 4U-40255

The IPC 4U-40255 is the perfect rack for a cost-effective server system.

Due to the excellent material quality combined with the excellent workmanship, Inter-Tech has created the basis for an extremely variable case.

So offers the IPC 4U-40255 the option of removing the mounting frame on both sides and thus installing up to six additional 5.25" external drives, up to 3x 5.25" external drives are available as standard. A maximum of 11x 3.5" or 4x 2.5" hard drives can be installed internally, depending on the configuration.

In addition, two 120mm and two 80mm fans reliably ensure optimal cooling.

Two easily accessible USB 3.0 front ports in the front and the lid with two snap-in closures complete the package.
