# 4U-4736

The IPC 4U 4736 is the perfect rack for a small and cost-effective storage system.

Inter-Tech has created the basis for an extremely variable case by combining outstanding material quality with excellent workmanship.

The case offers the possibility of installing a maximum of 36x 2.5" or 3.5" hot-swap hard disks, as well as optionally two 2.5" internal hard disks. The IPC 4U 4736 is equipped with seven 80mm hot swap fans as standard, which reliably ensure optimum cooling.

Additional extras such as the reusable and perforated low-profile slot brackets, USB 2.0 ports and the snap-in housing cover complete this excellent overall package.
