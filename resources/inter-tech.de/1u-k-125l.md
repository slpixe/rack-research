# IPC 1U-K-125L

The 1U K-125L is the perfect rack for a small and cost-effective server system. Its compact design and its small installation depth of 250mm for ITX boards allows this case to fit in to nearly every rack.

The 1U K-125L provides internal space for optional 1x 3.5" or 2x 2.5" hard drives. Two standard 40mm fans, which are internally mounted behind the front panel, ensure a reliable and optimal cooling. In the front are two USB 3.0 ports next to the controls.
