# IPC 1.5U-1528L

The 1.5U-1528L is the ideal case for a small and cheap server solution. The special design in 1.5U enables you to run two external drives (2.5" or 3.5") in Hot-Swap mode on an ITX-Mainboard base. The interior offers the option to mount two additional 2.5" drives and more height for CPU-cooler than a regular 1U case.

Two serial 60mm fans behind the front panel ensure a reliable cooling. It also offers two USB front connectors in the front, next to the controls.
