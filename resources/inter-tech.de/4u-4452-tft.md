# IPC 4U 4452-TFT

The 4U 4452-TFT - 19" Rack with TFT display and Keyboard/Mouse drawer.

With its built-in TFT display and built-in keyboard/mouse drawer, the 4U-4452 TFT is ideal for servers and workstations in locations where is no way for a 19" rack.

The Slim-DVD mounting can be removed in a few easy steps and enables a relaxed mounting of the Slim-DVD drive. Behind the lockable front door of the case are two hot-swap hard disk frames for either 2.5" or 3.5" drives, which also protects the external drives and USB ports against unauthorized access.
